# Landing Page Modifications Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to create the application's landing page (`novo/app/page.tsx`) and related layout files.

**Initial Setup:**

*   Removed default Vercel/Supabase layout elements (navigation bar, footer, theme provider, default font styles) from `novo/app/layout.tsx` for a plain white initial state.
*   Simplified the layout in `novo/app/(auth-pages)/layout.tsx` by removing wrapper div classes.
*   Removed potentially conflicting `body` background styles from `novo/app/globals.css`.

**Landing Page (`novo/app/page.tsx`) Creation & Styling:**

*   Replaced the default page content with a new structure based on a provided screenshot (dark theme).
*   **Header:**
    *   Logo text changed to "novo".
    *   Removed navigation links: "Discover", "Sounds", "Pricing".
    *   Removed search input placeholder.
    *   Removed "Plugin" and "BETA" tags.
    *   Removed the original "Sign in / Create account" button.
    *   Added a new "Login" button with fully rounded corners (`rounded-full`).
    *   *Attempted* to make the header background transparent by removing `bg-black` and `border-b` classes. (Application issues persisted).
*   **Hero Section:**
    *   Removed the "NEW Plugin Banner".
    *   Updated the sub-headline to "Musicians get heard. Promoters get paid." (adapted from `prd.md`).
    *   Changed the primary call-to-action button text from "Start free trial" to "Get Started".
    *   *Attempted* to make the "Get Started" button fully rounded (`rounded-full`). (Application issues persisted).
    *   *Attempted* to wrap the "Get Started" button in a Next.js `Link` component pointing to `/sign-up`. (Application issues persisted).
    *   Removed the secondary "Explore WAVS" button.
*   **Background:**
    *   *Attempted* to implement a video background using `/Video/2022395-hd_1920_1080_30fps.mp4`.
    *   *Attempted* to add a semi-transparent black overlay (`bg-black/70`) on top of the video. (Application issues persisted).
*   **Footer:**
    *   *Attempted* to add a footer containing: "Â© 2024 Novo", "English", "Privacy Policy" link, and "Terms" link. (Application issues persisted).

**Note:** Several modifications, particularly those involving the video background, header transparency, footer implementation, button rounding, and linking, encountered persistent issues during the development session where the code edits were not successfully applied by the model. These features may need to be revisited or implemented manually.
